This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn add` or `npm install` 

### then

### `npm start` or `yarn start` depending your package installer

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.


You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Technologies Used:`

`Create react App`

`Redux`

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.


`Firebase`

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs)


Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform acquired by Google in 2014. It provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help them build and scale their applications, including real-time databases, authentication, hosting, storage, messaging, and more.

Firebase's real-time database allows for real-time synchronization of data between clients, enabling developers to build applications that update data in real-time without the need for server-side code. Firebase Authentication provides easy-to-use authentication services, including support for email/password authentication, social login, and more.

Firebase Hosting provides developers with a fast and reliable way to host their web applications, while Firebase Storage allows for easy storage and retrieval of user-generated content like images and videos.

Firebase also includes a suite of cloud functions that allow developers to run server-side code without having to manage their own servers, as well as tools for analytics and performance monitoring.

Overall, Firebase is a powerful tool for developers looking to build high-quality mobile and web applications quickly and efficiently.
